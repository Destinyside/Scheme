# Scheme

if you are using android, you can download Termux and the Chicken scheme package, then you can use the Chicken scheme through following commands:
$ tar xzvf chi*
$ cd chi*
$ make PLATFORM=android
$ make PLATFORM=android install
$ csi

All these scheme files were tested by Chicken scheme. I wrote them on my android phone with the Termux.
